This notebook provides an example of using reverse correlation and bubbles method to probe a machine learning classifier.

Here, an SVM with a gaussian kernel is trained to classify MNIST handwritten digits and then the discriminative and prototypical information are revealed with bubbles and reverse correlation.

This notebook serves as a practical support for the course on xAI within the "Machine learning, from prediction to interpretation" Neuroschool Ph.D. program.
